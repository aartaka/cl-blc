#+TITLE:cl-blc

*cl-blc is a library and a CLI tool for working with Binary Lambda Calculus.*

cl-blc ~read~-s, ~eval~-uates and (pretty-) ~print~-s Binary Lambda Calculus expressions. Also includes a CLI tool for compilation of BLC (both one-bit and eight-bit encoding) to standalone executables and running it interactively.

See for more context:

* Getting Started
Clone the Git repository:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/aartaka/cl-blc ~/common-lisp/
#+end_src

And then load ~:cl-blc~ in the REPL:
#+begin_src lisp
  (asdf:load-system :cl-blc)
  ;; or, if you use Quicklisp
  (ql:quickload :cl-blc)
#+end_src

No dependencies required, it's all plain ANSI Common Lisp.

To make a CLI tool:
#+begin_src sh
  cd /path/to/cl-blc/
  make blc
#+end_src

And then use it like
#+begin_src sh
  $ ./blc compile /path/to/cl-blc/example/first.blc
  $ ./first input.txt
  h
  # or just provide input interactively, terminating with null char (Ctrl-D)
  $ ./first
  hello
  # Ctrl-D
  h
#+end_src

* Examples

See [[./source/package.lisp]] and docstrings for usage examples.
